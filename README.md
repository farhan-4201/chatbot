## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The design is centered around **Dark Elegance** and **Technological Sophistication**:
- **Palette**: Deep blacks (`#000000`), cyan glows, and purple accents.
- **Glassmorphism**: Transparent, blurred backgrounds for cards and navbars to create depth.
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle hover states and scroll-triggered animations to keep the user engaged.
